advancements in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT have created a lot of buzz in the tech industry. These models are incredibly powerful for content generation, but they also have some downsides such as bias(@nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset) and hallucinations(@Ji_2022). One area in which these LLMs can be particularly useful is chatbot development.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"applied_prompting/build_chatgpt":{"id":"applied_prompting/build_chatgpt","title":"\ud83d\udfe2 Build ChatGPT from GPT-3","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"applied_prompting/mc_tutorial":{"id":"applied_prompting/mc_tutorial","title":"\ud83d\udfe2 Multiple Choice Questions","description":"Let\'s use GPT to solve an LSAT question!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"applied_prompting/overview":{"id":"applied_prompting/overview","title":"\ud83d\udfe2 Introduction","description":"Now we will discuss the end-to-end prompt engineering process via articles written","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"applied_prompting/short_response":{"id":"applied_prompting/short_response","title":"\ud83d\udfe2 Solve Discussion Questions","description":"With the right prompting, GPT-3 is very capable of writing short form responses.
